    Interest in IT

<p>
    <ul>
        <li class="line">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</li>
        IT covers a lot of fields, one of which that strikes me the most is Mobile Application. <br>
        The first time this occured to me was when i saw the news about an App game name "Angry Bird" that was very popular at the time.<br>
        The creator is a Vietnamese person, and with only one app, he becomes famous to the World. This really inspired me to do the same.<br>
        To this day, i have learned some knowledge about making website, small App.<br>
        <li class="line">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li>
        I believe RMIT possesess the best facilities in all of Vietnam. Together with the study program which is equivalent to Melbourne's, i believe this will provide me the best experience in study IT.<br>
        <li class="line">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li>
        After some basic finding about the study program, i believe i will learn most skills in all the fields of IT, although i don't know to which degree. However, i believe after these years, i will know what is most suited field for me to participate in.<br>

        <li class="line">Result of Myers-Briggs test from https://www.16personalities.com</li>
        <img src="Screen%20Shot%202020-07-29%20at%205.06.39%20PM.png" width="800" height="900">
        <li class="line">Meaning of this test</li>
        Throuhout the test, i get to see many different question in which i had the chance to revaluate my personality. Together with the result i can see some of my strength and weakness, although i don't really believe all of it, but it did give me a lot of insight.<br><br>
        My strength lies in these personalities: supportive, reliable, patient, observant, enthusiastic, loyal and hardworking. These helps me gain a good connection to others people around me, make me a good people to rely on. This is a good thing to have when working in real world. I am also observant, patient but enthusiastic at the same time. This mean that i rarely make mistake, always move after i have established a plan, and once i do, i move with all my might. Finally, hardworking, i think this goes without saying.<br><br>
        My weakness also can't be ignored. I am humble and shy, this isn't much now because i tried to change this for many years. However, it's still there as this is part of my personality. Humble is a good thing, but this also mean that if you don't show your ability, you lose out many opportunity to make profit for yourself. The same can be said for shy, too shy and you can't even deal with real world. Altruistic, i care too much about what i think and what other people think. Because i care too much about my own feeling, i often get affected by what other people say about me, this create stresses, anxiety, to the point that sometimes i go out of my way to fight them back. And, well it's not good to fight your boss.<br><br>
        All and all, seeing this test doesn't encourage or discourage me from being a developer, but it does help me see things from different points of view to improve myself.<br>

        <li class="line">Meaning of this test</li>
        I'm a visual learner, which i already noticed throughout my years of study. I can learn by ears, but i learn better by eyes. Whenever i do research, i often look for video, picture first, if not available then i will proceed to text ( for IT specificially, i often when to Youtube to see guide if it's available)

        <li class="line">Meaning of this test</li>
        I have a bit under average score for Openess(46%), it describes how a person often think in abstract, complex ways. This is how i view art and the like, not interested,not hated. I listen to music, watch movie sometimes to relax but it never stay on my mind, i'm more of a practical person. <br>
        I have a similar score for Conscientiousness( 48%), it describes a person’s self-discipline. Out of all the 5 scores, this is the only score that i don't agree with, while my self-discipline is not the best, especially when i don't have motivation. However, once i do, i give it the best with all my strength days and nights. <br>
        I have a low socre for Extraversion(40%), it describes a person’s desire to get attention from other people. This score is the usual extrovert vs introvert, and it's true that i often stay on the introvert side. However, i can still communicate well with other people given the need. <br>
        I score a bit high on Agreeableness(60%), it describes how often a person think about other people's. This could be considered positive, and i do think like that. However, there are situation when this backfire, which is if you think too much about these things, you just give yourself a lot of stresses. <br>
        I score pretty high on Neuroticism(67%), it describes how often a person think negatively. This is straight up bad, and i agree with the score. I often think negatively given situations, although i tried to improve it for a long times and it lessen the fear. If i score this many years ago, it would be much higher. <br>
        <li class="line">How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</li>
        When in a team, i find that i'm not really suit as a leader due to my own personality, i'm too soft and "shy" to be a leader who i believe to need a really good communicate skill as well as a stern personality. However, i can be good key that combine a lot of people to work in a team since i believe people are often open up to me. They tend to talk to me about different issues, both technical and conflict in the team. Then again, i believe this is temporary since things can change. I hope when step into the real world, i'll learn enough soft skills to be able to become a Team leader.
        <li class="line">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</li>
        With this personality, i should find someone who can lead, or at least be able to rally people up, can give order and can make people accepting that order. But the most important thing is their skill, i believe Team Work only effective if people are at close level, or at least decent and are willing to learn and improve, especially in university project. I believe for any person, when forming a team, you want to look for someone who can cooperate with you, not someone who can carry you or vice versa.

    Project Ideas
</h1>
<ul>
    <li class="line">Overview</li>
    I want to create a website that belong to "nutrition" category named "Nutrient Calculator". Nutrient Calculator has one main feature which is to calculate the nutrients like calorie, protein, fats, carbohydrates your body need in one day,week or month when given body's statistic such as weight and height. It also has a lot more interesting features within.
    <li class="line">Motivation</li>
    I believe "Nutrient Caculator" is a really interesting and useful website that support many needs of people. Since the beginning, healthcare is always important no matter what situation, this is why hospitals, medicines are vital. However, if those help you when you are already sick, take care of your body so it doesn't get sick is as important. For your body to be well, you don't need a big amount of nutrition, you need a "right" amount of nutrition, and Nutrient Calculator can help you with that.
    <li class="line">Description</li>
    Nutrient Calculator has 4 features: <br>
    1. It will ask for your body's status, then it will begin to calculate the amount of nutrient (protein,calorie,fat, etc) base on your choice that is suitable for your body to absorb. You can choose between three options, which are per day, per week and per month, it will divide or multiply accordingly. <br>
    2. (Ideally) The website is connect to a database which has a list of food ingredients, each one has a value of nutrition per 100 gram. Users can use this "wiki" to search for information they want to know. <br>
    3. (Ideally) You can choose different ingredients as well as well their amount (in term of gram) and add up to a Calculator. This calculator will give you the serving size of nutrition for each meal. By doing this users can control the nutrients they eat better per day. <br>
    4. (Ideally) Before calculating the amount of nutrient, there are many check boxes that are labled with different diseases and condition such as diabetes, high/low blood pressure, etc . When checked, the final amount of nutrient your body need will raise up/lower down some percentage accordingly.
    <li class="line">Tools and Technologies</li>
    Physical tools: a PC or laptop, pen and paper to do sketches/prototype. <br>
    Software: Visual Studio Code for coding both front end and back end. MySQL and Pycharm for database. <br>
    Coding Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
    <li class="line">Skills Required </li>
    1. Know how to use software like VSCode, MySQL, Pycharm and the Coding Languages that are associated with them (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) <br>
    2. Ability to work as a team through communication and the use of git,github. <br>
    These requirements are not hard to acquire. Everyone have a PC or laptop. All the software listed above are free, the coding Languages can be learned through guide online such as https://www.w3schools.com. However, you can do it is different than you can do it "well". To be able to make a good website, i need to try my best. 
    <li class="line">Outcome</li>
    If Nutrient Calculator is finished ideally, all kinds of people are more or less benefits. Whether you are an gymnastic who want to control your nutrient, an patience who have a carbohydrates problem, or just someone who interest on seeing the required nutrients, you may want to use this app. As for the impact, this project isn't about some great features that will shake the world, but i believe it can help everyone, if they choose to use it.
