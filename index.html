    Interest in IT
</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li class="line">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</li>
        IT covers a lot of fields, one of which that strikes me the most is Mobile Application. <br>
        The first time this occured to me was when i saw the news about an App game name "Angry Bird" that was very popular at the time.<br>
        The creator is a Vietnamese person, and with only one app, he becomes famous to the World. This really inspired me to do the same.<br>
        To this day, i have learned some knowledge about making website, small App.<br>
        <li class="line">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li>
        I believe RMIT possesess the best facilities in all of Vietnam. Together with the study program which is equivalent to Melbourne's, i believe this will provide me the best experience in study IT.<br>
        <li class="line">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li>
        After some basic finding about the study program, i believe i will learn most skills in all the fields of IT, although i don't know to which degree. However, i believe after these years, i will know what is most suited field for me to participate in.<br>

        <li class="line">Meaning of this test</li>
        Throuhout the test, i get to see many different question in which i had the chance to revaluate my personality. Together with the result i can see some of my strength and weakness, although i don't really believe all of it, but it did give me a lot of insight.<br><br>
        My strength lies in these personalities: supportive, reliable, patient, observant, enthusiastic, loyal and hardworking. These helps me gain a good connection to others people around me, make me a good people to rely on. This is a good thing to have when working in real world. I am also observant, patient but enthusiastic at the same time. This mean that i rarely make mistake, always move after i have established a plan, and once i do, i move with all my might. Finally, hardworking, i think this goes without saying.<br><br>
        My weakness also can't be ignored. I am humble and shy, this isn't much now because i tried to change this for many years. However, it's still there as this is part of my personality. Humble is a good thing, but this also mean that if you don't show your ability, you lose out many opportunity to make profit for yourself. The same can be said for shy, too shy and you can't even deal with real world. Altruistic, i care too much about what i think and what other people think. Because i care too much about my own feeling, i often get affected by what other people say about me, this create stresses, anxiety, to the point that sometimes i go out of my way to fight them back. And, well it's not good to fight your boss.<br><br>
        All and all, seeing this test doesn't encourage or discourage me from being a developer, but it does help me see things from different points of view to improve myself.<br>

        I'm a visual learner, which i already noticed throughout my years of study. I can learn by ears, but i learn better by eyes. Whenever i do research, i often look for video, picture first, if not available then i will proceed to text ( for IT specificially, i often when to Youtube to see guide if it's available)

        <li class="line">Meaning of this test</li>
        I have a bit under average score for Openess(46%), it describes how a person often think in abstract, complex ways. This is how i view art and the like, not interested,not hated. I listen to music, watch movie sometimes to relax but it never stay on my mind, i'm more of a practical person. <br>
        I have a similar score for Conscientiousness( 48%), it describes a person’s self-discipline. Out of all the 5 scores, this is the only score that i don't agree with, while my self-discipline is not the best, especially when i don't have motivation. However, once i do, i give it the best with all my strength days and nights. <br>
        I have a low socre for Extraversion(40%), it describes a person’s desire to get attention from other people. This score is the usual extrovert vs introvert, and it's true that i often stay on the introvert side. However, i can still communicate well with other people given the need. <br>
        I score a bit high on Agreeableness(60%), it describes how often a person think about other people's. This could be considered positive, and i do think like that. However, there are situation when this backfire, which is if you think too much about these things, you just give yourself a lot of stresses. <br>
        I score pretty high on Neuroticism(67%), it describes how often a person think negatively. This is straight up bad, and i agree with the score. I often think negatively given situations, although i tried to improve it for a long times and it lessen the fear. If i score this many years ago, it would be much higher. <br>
        <li class="line">How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</li>
        When in a team, i find that i'm not really suit as a leader due to my own
